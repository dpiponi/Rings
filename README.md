Simulation of perturbation of planetary rings by "shepherd" moons
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Compare the result of this simulation with the actual photo of one of Saturn's rings below. They both have the "scalloped" look.
The simulation only implements one way coupling of moon (and planet) to ring. No ring-ring self-interaction.
